Discussion points
-----------------

* Should we drop the hierarchy field in HMMProfile? Could be replaced by a --
  rather cheap I think since the hierarchy is shallow -- orderstring method on 
  objects that calculates a concatenated string of ids: 00001:00002:00003 for an
  object with id 3 at level three of the hierarchy (perhaps we need more than
  five digits).

Things to fix
-------------
* Tests that are not yet implemented:
  - Hierarchy of taxon
  - The dry run initialization

* Possible optimizations:
  - Add index on taxon_id in sll-biosql project, not used often, therefore not neccessary
  - Use rails built in sql-increment count when iterating over the protein_counts
    would speed up calculate-step.

* Set up system to enable links from accession numbers to target database. See
  doc/sequence_inclusion.dia (SequenceDatabase model). Note the comments
  regarding the accession_url field.

* Replace only HMMProfile name in lists with HMMProfile.description (which
  includes the protein name.

* When AJAX expandable table/list is implemented for the ProteinCount, 
  use it for the pfitmap_release show page as well. 

* Enable sorting on columns as a default feature for all tables.

* Test visual performance in all major browsers

* Make the taxon name in the expandable list an ajax link for
  updating a protein_counts summary table

* Make protein_counts index page possible to govern by a "level"-dropdown

* Search function for hmm_db_hits/db_sequences

* Add file_name to hmm_results so that it's easier to debug if the wrong 
  file has been uploaded.

* Add possibility to 'remove as current' for pfitmap releases
