Discussion points
-----------------

* Should we drop the hierarchy field in HMMProfile? Could be replaced by a --
  rather cheap I think since the hierarchy is shallow -- orderstring method on 
  objects that calculates a concatenated string of ids: 00001:00002:00003 for an
  object with id 3 at level three of the hierarchy (perhaps we need more than
  five digits).

* The server has shown some significant weaknesses with memory leak, 
  it allocates allmost all available memory, and this has led to at least
  one crash. This is possibly caused by delayed_job and/or its dependencies
  such as 'daemons' gem. The problem was first observed short after these had
  been deployed. The problem does not appear in development environment, so 
  it could be due to caching, although most caching is now turned off, 
  (I believe). 

Things to fix
-------------
* Tests that are not yet implemented:
  - Hierarchy of taxon
  - The dry run initialization
  - protein_counts_by_rank
  - protein_counts_by_hierarchy

* Set up system to enable links from accession numbers to target database. See
  doc/sequence_inclusion.dia (SequenceDatabase model). Note the comments
  regarding the accession_url field.

* Replace only HMMProfile name in lists with HMMProfile.description (which
  includes the protein name.

* When AJAX expandable table/list is implemented for the ProteinCount, 
  use it for the pfitmap_release show page as well. 

* Enable sorting on columns as a default feature for all tables.

* Test visual performance in all major browsers

* Make the taxon name in the expandable list an ajax link for
  updating a protein_counts summary table

* Search function for hmm_db_hits/db_sequences

* Add file_name to hmm_results so that it's easier to debug if the wrong 
  file has been uploaded.

* Add possibility to 'remove as current' for pfitmap releases

* From pfitmap_release show, link from a row to the not_included db_sequences
  from there, make it possible to include a db_sequence, previously not included
  the first task needs a custom controller method and route for db_sequences

* Sequence source show page does not have a good overview
  of which proteins that have results registered, when there are many 
  hmm_profiles.

* Delayed job does not operate currently on server since smtp-settings are
  not fixed for action mailer. Could disable action mailer temporarily in order
  to execute calculation for the release.
