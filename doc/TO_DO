Discussion points
-----------------

* Should we drop the hierarchy field in HMMProfile? Could be replaced by a --
  rather cheap I think since the hierarchy is shallow -- orderstring method on 
  objects that calculates a concatenated string of ids: 00001:00002:00003 for an
  object with id 3 at level three of the hierarchy (perhaps we need more than
  five digits).

Things to fix
-------------

* Set up system to enable links from accession numbers to target database. See
  doc/sequence_inclusion.dia (SequenceDatabase model). Note the comments
  regarding the accession_url field.

* Replace only HMMProfile.name on its own in lists with HMMProfile.description
  (which includes the protein name).
